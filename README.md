This program's current committed state is a functioning UI that includes a login screen, create account screen, and a close to blank dashboard. All include custom artwork. 

This programs full intention is for parents to track their childrens online schooling progress by keeping data on certain things like mouse clicks, keystrokes, active time within an app, and so on. The program will then create a score from all of this information and add the user to an online database containing scores for each users. Within the users dashboard is the scoreboard showing the scores of the top ten students along with the current users ranking on the scoreboard. This adds an interactive aspect to learning, and keeps the children interested in and stimulated while learning through their schooling applications.

This code was written over the span of a couple months with no prior JFX experience as well as being a beginner in terms of programming. This is not an accurate depiction of the current state of my programming skills and clean code practices. This is more conceptual and shows the use of object-oriented programming as a young programmer.
